- Title includes like I am frontend dev with interested in reactjs, js java and exploring web3 blockvhain, nft and solidty kind off.
- Intro includes my data like 3-4 lines just a brief about me. it should be in the middle i mean in the center of portfolio, if possible make it È§way for my photo also so I can place my photo over there . Inlcuding buttons to all my socials, like LinkedIn, github, leetcode, medium and lot of others, arrange it neatly so it doesn't look like clumsy
- education includes my two timelines, university and high secondary school, make it time line theme or kind off another
- technical and soft skills includes my all kind of skills with a very creative way of showing them in UI
- work experience includes my 2-3 experiences with title and little description and also data/year of it
-projects section should include in a very different and creative manner, like as I am developer the projects section should be in the developer read, like program theme for projects, as I scroll down the project section should open and the previous should back to go normal position, and it should continue for all projects. Scroll down the first project should enlarge then it should go up de-enlarge then second  project enlarge. Inside project section, it should be like title, description, images of it, github link, live demo link.
- certificates is optional one but make it cute 
- extra activities, includes all other activities apart from academic and other things like may be sports, clubs smtg,
- contact includes whtsapp msg sender, and email. For whtsapp It should take API of whtsap, so when someone click on button it should redirect to my number directly and open whsatpp, take the input in the field and text that input to the number directly in the prefferd number in whstapp, email also same, take the input and goes directly mail tot the specified email.
- footer includes some my social links and right reserved and all. 
-  it should also includes a blog section, because I write blog in the medium so I have show it n my portfolio so others can read it.


So all the CSS should be in the 3D animations and effects, as a programmer the portfolio should be attractive and awesome, with cool effects, with light/dark theme button. Make sure the accurate responsive design for all kind of devices, from mobile to TV, laptops. Dont make the background so boring. Dont make the background color plane. Keep the spice on. 

I also have beyonce, unstop, intershala, bento and others profiles etc. I thought to showcase them also, so make a way for them also without making to look like, portfolio is filled and clumsy. Please ensure better and awesome CSS, with programmer , developer, and graphic designer UI, with lot of cool effects and 3D animations, transition.
